Welcome to use our scooter management system. 
Here are some tip for running the system.
	1. Open the "cmd".
	2.Use command "cd" to point to this folder.
	2. Compile & Run the "systemControl.java"
	(Command:	javac systemControl.java)
	(Command:	java systemControl)
	*****************************!!!This is important!!!**********************
	If command appears "Note: SystemControl. Java uses unchecked or unsafe operations"
	"Note: For more information, use - Xlint: unchecked to recompile"
	Don't mind. Just go on Run, don't need to compile again
