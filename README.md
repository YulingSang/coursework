Welcome to use our scooter management system. 

Here are some tip for running the system.

1.  Open the "cmd".

2.  Use command "cd" to point to this folder.

3.  Compile & Run the "systemControl.java"

    (Command:	javac systemControl.java)
  
	  (Command:	java systemControl)
  
*************************************************************************

If command appears "Note: SystemControl. Java uses unchecked or unsafe operations"

"Note: For more information, use - Xlint: unchecked to recompile"

Don't mind. Just go on Run, don't need to compile again
